## A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away...

In the vast expanse of the **digital universe**, where the lines between reality and illusion blur, we find ourselves entangled in the web of **social media** and virtual distractions. **Instagram, Facebook**, and countless other platforms have become our daily companions, pulling us into an alternate reality where **likes, shares, and comments** dictate our worth. Yet, in this chase for virtual validation, we often lose touch with the **true essence of life**.

Amidst this digital turmoil, a **new hope** arises. This repository seeks to shine a light on the importance of **living a life grounded in reality**, embracing **genuine human connections**, and fostering an environment that nurtures our **minds and souls**.

### The Path to Serenity

#### What Serenity Means

Serenity is the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled. It’s about finding inner peace and balance, even amidst the chaos of daily life. Achieving serenity involves creating a supportive environment that fosters relaxation, focus, and positive energy.

To reclaim our lives from these digital distractions, we must cultivate a space that reflects our **true selves**. A well-organized, clean, and inspiring environment is essential for **studying, relaxing**, and simply **enjoying life**. Surround yourself with **positivity**, and let your surroundings uplift your spirit.

Much like the force that binds the galaxy together, our surroundings influence our state of mind. The **music** we listen to, the people we interact with, and the environments we inhabit can either lift us up or bring us down. A **cluttered room breeds a cluttered mind**, while a serene space fosters **clarity and focus**.

### Steps to Improve Your Life

In the quest for a balanced and fulfilling life, follow these steps, much like a mindful map through the galaxy:

1. **Declutter Your Space:** Start with your physical environment. Clean and organize your surroundings to create a peaceful and inspiring atmosphere.
   - _Story:_ When I was a kid, I lived in a pretty messy room. Shirts and pants on the sofa, a desk cluttered with papers, and a floor that was never cleared by myself—my parents did everything. When I started living on my own at 17, I realized how hard it is to keep everything organized. So, I cleaned up, decided on perfect places for almost everything, and made it a habit to clean my room once a week. Sometimes, life gets messy, but it's normal. Just remember to try and keep things clean. My football coach always said we win the match by how we behave in the changing room, how we talk to our parents, and how we show respect. I think he was right!
2. **Digital Detox:** Limit your screen time and disconnect from social media. Spend more time engaging in real-life activities and connecting with loved ones.
   - _Story:_ From ages 13 to 18, I was totally consumed by social media. I spent hours on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, just doom scrolling and wasting time. I thought I was learning from YouTube, but now I realize I don't remember much from it. YouTube is good if you have a passion for something, but you need to control your usage. Now, I spend around 2 hours a day on my phone and plan to reduce it to 1 hour or less. I believe AI recommendations and big data algorithms can control our minds if we aren't careful. To prevent this, I'm switching to a more private setup with a secure browser and tracking system to protect my data.
3. **Think Positively About Your Abilities:** Believe in yourself and your environment. Never tell yourself you can't do something or that you are an idiot. Confidence in your abilities is key.
   - _Story:_ My very wise and smart relative taught me to always think positively about myself. If you believe you can do something, your brain's energy activates the muscles to achieve the desired result. Confidence in your abilities makes a big difference.
4. **Nurture Relationships:** Invest time in building and maintaining authentic human connections. Real-life interactions bring more satisfaction and joy than virtual ones.
   - _Story:_ When I was in my era of development from 14 to 17, I thought that social media was kind of the same as real life. But in reality, I couldn't talk with girls, for instance. It was so much easier to talk in messenger than in real life. My situation with finding a soulmate at the age of 18 seemed pathetic. I couldn't say two sentences to someone I was attracted to, even though I could spend the night chatting with that person. In school, I actually had a couple of interactions like that. I was chatting with the girl I liked and then in school just pretended that she didn't exist, although I didn't want to really, it just happened sort of. It happened a lot of times and all the time it was like this for me. So, I needed a change, and at the age of 18, I started approaching random strangers and having small talks. Really, it feels different when you can, by interaction, improve somebody's day or just understand something cool. I started by complimenting girls that I liked. Of course, I formed some rules that I should follow in order to do that, so I decided that I should really approach someone if I felt so, only if I felt good, I was not tired, I was clean, and I earnestly felt like approaching and it was true that I was attracted. It was not every day, no, it was less frequently, I am not a jerk, it was like once in a while. After 1 year, I got like 7 or 8 people that I approached, and now I can confirm that I am more confident with myself and with other people. I learned a lot. My list of rules of approaching was not made out of the blue; it was made because I understood what things are important.
5. **Pursue Passions:** Engage in hobbies and activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Creativity and passion are essential for a happy and balanced life.
   - _Story:_ I tried a lot of things for myself. The main idea was to keep myself more or less busy and not spend a lot of time on social media. I valued time spent learning new skills or honing existing ones more than wasting my time on social media. So, I learned how to juggle, whelle on a bike, do origami, draw, play the piano, improve my English, and many other things that I won't share with you To keep a little mystery. For instance, I felt cool showing off my origamis and my cool interior. I had some pictures painted in a specific manner, and I had Baby Yoda on my wall in the Sahara Desert :)
6. **Overcome Fear of Failure:** Understand that embarrassment is only in your head, and people generally don’t care. Don’t be afraid to fail and learn from your experiences.
   - _Story:_ By approaching strangers, I learned how to overcome the fear of embarrassment through failure. For example, my first time approaching someone, I felt pretty good. I was riding my bike and saw three very nice-looking ladies. I felt like I couldn't do it, spent like 10 minutes thinking and kind of stalking them, but then while riding, I shortened the distance. I said hello, was polite and respectful, and told them they looked great. They started smiling, and I felt that I had greatly improved their day. It was a nice small interaction; we just wished each other a good day, and I left. It was a perfect first approach, and I liked it a lot. I felt so proud of myself and empowered by this. As I was riding back, I saw another girl and quickly told her she looked great. But I realized it wasn't genuine; I didn't mean it. I felt that I didn't bring much joy to her or myself. I felt bad, felt filthy. I understood that I could make people's lives happier by being honest, but following irrelevant thoughts could make someone's day worse. Therefore, I should be more careful. I made a list of rules and started following it. Only after about a month did I make my next approach, and it was a great experience for me!
7. **Do Cool Things:** If you're unsure of what to learn or do, pursue anything you think would be cool to show off to others. Showing off can be naturally good as it motivates you and can lead to impressive

accomplishments. 8. **Accept Your Influences:** It's natural to take inspiration from others. I've often felt that everything I do or say is influenced by someone else. Don't worry about it—learning from others is good. Be aware of your actions and embrace the uniqueness that comes from combining various influences into your own style.

- _Story:_ I often copy somebody, some quotes that are not mine, some thoughts or actions that are not mine. I often don't realize that something is possible or current. Often in skateboarding, skating the miniramp, I do kind of the same tricks. But when my friend does something I forgot I should try, I'm always like, oh I forgot about that one, should I try :)

9. **Stay Social:** While it's possible to isolate yourself, it's better to be social. You can find many beautiful conversations and people. Engage with others and build meaningful connections.
   - _Story:_ When I was in my first semester of Uni, I didn't socialize a lot, maybe a couple of sentences per day, but that's it. I was in my grind stage, where I didn't enjoy life, I just grinded. I listened to grinderes, and the funny thing is I was so mad I was like, this guy is bad, I wanna be better than him. So, I said to myself, grind grind grind. I forgot about life, I didn't keep enjoying it, just grind, nothing else. I learned from it. Now I balance life with joy and happiness, not only grind. Everything in moderation is an important proverb. So, if you are in the grind mindset, please, think and be aware that it might be good for you, it might be bad!
10. **Balance Showing Off:** When I skated, I realized I was sometimes doing tricks to impress girls. I felt embarrassed and scared of being seen as a creep or weirdo. But I accepted it as part of my fun. If you enjoy something and part of it is for impressing others, that's okay. Don't overthink it—be yourself, with no mask on.
    - _Story:_ I don't do wheelies on a bike if there are people on my way or nearby. This is the rule, no matter how I feel, it doesn't matter. I won't risk people's health for my joy.
11. **Be Mindful of Your Consequences:** Always be aware of the potential consequences of your actions. If you do something risky to show off, you might endanger yourself and others. For example, don't let the desire to impress lead you to reckless behavior, like crashing into a small child at a skate park. Analyze your behavior and understand the meaning of your actions for the best outcome.
    - _Story:_ Don't be rude with people, understand them. Don't be mad at a kid in the skatepark. I always try to think first, not just scream at my parents that they are wrong. No, I quit this behavior!
12. **Respect and Consideration:** Life is about respect and thinking of others, even when they're not around. For example, my parents taught me to put two rolls of toilet paper near the sink for guests. If one runs out, they have a backup. Small acts of thoughtfulness make a big difference.
    - _Story:_ I like the respect I was taught. Seriously, almost no problems with human interactions. I earn their value by being respectful: holding the door for a lady, proposing my help, being on time, speaking with clarity so people can understand. We live in a respectful world; respect is earned and trusted in.
13. **Control Your Emotions:** Always keep your emotions in balance. If something irritates you, take a moment to think before reacting. Don't rush to say something hurtful or insulting. Strive to bring maximum joy and minimize negativity in the world.
14. **Seek Feedback:** Seek both positive and negative feedback from others. When someone criticizes you, listen carefully—it might be true. Similarly, when you receive praise, reflect on it and be proud of your achievements.
15. **Embrace Your Emotions:** Sometimes you may feel really bad, and that’s okay. Feeling sad or down is a natural part of life. Remember, life is beautiful even in tough times. Your emotions are real and valid, and they are a part of the beautiful experience of being human.
