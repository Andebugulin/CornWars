## A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away...

In the vast expanse of the **digital universe**, where the lines between reality and illusion blur, we find ourselves entangled in the web of **social media** and virtual distractions. **Instagram, Facebook**, and countless other platforms have become our daily companions, pulling us into an alternate reality where **likes, shares, and comments** dictate our worth. Yet, in this chase for virtual validation, we often lose touch with the **true essence of life**.

Amidst this digital turmoil, a **new hope** arises. This repository seeks to shine a light on the importance of **living a life grounded in reality**, embracing **genuine human connections**, and fostering an environment that nurtures our **minds and souls**.

### The Path to Serenity

#### What Serenity Means

Serenity is the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled. It’s about finding inner peace and balance, even amidst the chaos of daily life. Achieving serenity involves creating a supportive environment that fosters relaxation, focus, and positive energy.

To reclaim our lives from these digital distractions, we must cultivate a space that reflects our **true selves**. A well-organized, clean, and inspiring environment is essential for **studying, relaxing**, and simply **enjoying life**. Surround yourself with **positivity**, and let your surroundings uplift your spirit.

Much like the force that binds the galaxy together, our surroundings influence our state of mind. The **music** we listen to, the people we interact with, and the environments we inhabit can either lift us up or bring us down. A **cluttered room breeds a cluttered mind**, while a serene space fosters **clarity and focus**.

_"Clear your space, clear your mind will be."_ - Master Yoda

### Our Mission

This repository is dedicated to exploring projects and philosophies that aim to create the **perfect environment** for **personal growth** and **well-being**. Whether it's through organizing your space, managing your digital footprint, or nurturing your mental health, our goal is to help you rediscover the beauty of life.

_"Rediscover the beauty of life, you must. Within yourself, the answers lie."_ - Master Yoda

### Chapters

#### Chapter 1: Decluttering Your Space

**Description:** In the vast galaxy, Jedi Knights know the importance of a clear and organized mind. The clutter of physical spaces can lead to distractions and disturbances in the Force. This chapter explores the art of decluttering to maintain an orderly and serene environment.

**Project:** Develop a **Day Planner** application to help Jedi Padawans and Masters alike schedule their daily tasks, cleaning routines, and meditation times to keep their spaces in harmony.

- _Story:_
  > When I was a kid, I lived in a pretty messy room. Shirts and pants on the sofa, a desk cluttered with papers, and a floor that was never cleared by myself—my parents did everything. When I started living on my own at 17, I realized how hard it is to keep everything organized. So, I cleaned up, decided on perfect places for almost everything, and made it a habit to clean my room once a week. Sometimes, life gets messy, but it's normal. Just remember to try and keep things clean. My football coach always said we win the match by how we behave in the changing room, how we talk to our parents, and how we show respect. I think he was right!

#### Chapter 2: Digital Detox

**Description:** Across the galaxy, many beings have fallen prey to the seductive allure of the Holonet and its constant stream of information. Jedi must learn to disconnect and focus on the present moment. This chapter delves into the practice of digital detox to regain control over one’s mind.

**Project:** Create a **Screen Time Tracker** app that monitors your Holonet usage and suggests offline activities like lightsaber training or meditation to help maintain balance.

- _Story:_
  > From ages 13 to 18, I was totally consumed by social media. I spent hours on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, just doom scrolling and wasting time. I thought I was learning from YouTube, but now I realize I don't remember much from it. YouTube is good if you have a passion for something, but you need to control your usage. Now, I spend around 2 hours a day on my phone and plan to reduce it to 1 hour or less. I believe AI recommendations and big data algorithms can control our minds if we aren't careful. To prevent this, I'm switching to a more private setup with a secure browser and tracking system to protect my data.

#### Chapter 4: Nurturing Relationships

**Project:** Develop a **Social Interaction** app that tracks social activities, reminds you to check in with friends, and suggests conversation starters to help strengthen your bonds with others.

- _Story:_
  > When I was in my era of development from 14 to 17, I thought that social media was kind of the same as real life. But in reality, I couldn't talk with girls, for instance. It was so much easier to talk in messenger than in real life. My situation with finding a soulmate at the age of 18 seemed pathetic. I couldn't say two sentences to someone I was attracted to, even though I could spend the night chatting with that person. In school, I actually had a couple of interactions like that. I was chatting with the girl I liked and then in school just pretended that she didn't exist, although I didn't want to really, it just happened sort of. It happened a lot of times and all the time it was like this for me. So, I needed a change, and at the age of 18, I started approaching random strangers and having small talks. Really, it feels different when you can, by interaction, improve somebody's day or just understand something cool. I started by complimenting girls that I liked. Of course, I formed some rules that I should follow in order to do that, so I decided that I should really approach someone if I felt so, only if I felt good, I was not tired, I was clean, and I earnestly felt like approaching and it was true that I was attracted. It was not every day, no, it was less frequently, I am not a jerk, it was like once in a while. After 1 year, I got like 7 or 8 people that I approached, and now I can confirm that I am more confident with myself and with other people. I learned a lot. My list of rules of approaching was not made out of the blue; it was made because I understood what things are important.

**Project:** Create a **Hobby Tracker** app that allows users to set goals, track progress, and discover new hobbies to enhance their connection with the Force.

- _Story:_
  > I tried a

lot of things for myself. The main idea was to keep myself more or less busy and not spend a lot of time on social media. I valued time spent learning new skills or honing existing ones more than wasting my time on social media. So, I learned how to juggle, wheelie on a bike, do origami, draw, play the piano, improve my English, and many other things that I won't share with you To keep a little mystery. For instance, I felt cool showing off my origamis and my cool interior. I had some pictures painted in a specific manner, and I had Baby Yoda on my wall in the Sahara Desert :)

- _Story:_
  > By approaching strangers, I learned how to overcome the fear of embarrassment through failure. For example, my first time approaching someone, I felt pretty good. I was riding my bike and saw three very nice-looking ladies. I felt like I couldn't do it, spent like 10 minutes thinking and kind of stalking them, but then while riding, I shortened the distance. I said hello, was polite and respectful, and told them they looked great. They started smiling, and I felt that I had greatly improved their day. It was a nice small interaction; we just wished each other a good day, and I left. It was a perfect first approach, and I liked it a lot. I felt so proud of myself and empowered by this. As I was riding back, I saw another girl and quickly told her she looked great. But I realized it wasn't genuine; I didn't mean it. I felt that I didn't bring much joy to her or myself. I felt bad, felt filthy. I understood that I could make people's lives happier by being honest, but following irrelevant thoughts could make someone's day worse. Therefore, I should be more careful. I made a list of rules and started following it. Only after about a month did I make my next approach, and it was a great experience for me!

Often in skateboarding, skating the miniramp, I do kind of the same tricks. But when my friend does something I forgot I should try, I'm always like, oh I forgot about that one, should I try :)

I listened to grinderes, and the funny thing is I was so mad I was like, this guy is bad, I wanna be better than him. So, I said to myself, grind grind grind. I forgot about life, I didn't keep enjoying it, just grind, nothing else. I learned from it. Now I balance life with joy and happiness, not only grind. Everything in moderation is an important proverb. So, if you are in the grind mindset, please, think and be aware that it might be good for you, it might be bad!

This is the rule, no matter how I feel, it doesn't matter. I won't risk people's health for my joy.
